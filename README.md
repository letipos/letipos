# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there
I'm Leo, a data scientist specializing in designing and implementing advanced AI and data solutions to drive business success. My passion lies in building innovative machine learning models and analytics tools that empower companies and teams to make decisions. 

Currently, I serve as a Data Science Consultant at IBM, focusing on productionizing data science and ML proof-of-concepts and projects. I took the lead in publishing technical assets, implemented CI/CD pipelines and  integrated AI and data solutions into real-world projects.
I am dedicated to continuously improving my skills and expertise in data science and AI to make a significant impact through data-driven decision making. 

# ðŸ¤– Tech
I have a strong proficiency in Python and SQL, which are my main programming languages. Additionally, I have completed projects utilizing MATLAB, C++, and Java
On a daily basis, I work extensively with various technologies such as Python, Pandas, PySpark, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Git, Linux, and Docker. 
I possess a passion for natural language processing and have a keen interest in transformative technologies like LLM, Conversational Generative AI, and Prompt Engineering. I am driven by the potential of these advancements to revolutionize how we interact with and understand human language.

# ðŸŽ“ Academia
During my bachelor's program in Applied Computer Science at Georg-August-University GÃ¶ttingen, I delved into foundational concepts of computer science, including Software Engineering, Algorithms, Database Management, and advanced Mathematics. Additionally, I had my first exposure to the exciting field of Data Science through my thesis project, where I explored the modeling of a neuron in the visual cortex using a neural network at the [German Primate Center GÃ¶ttingen]([https://www.dpz.eu/en/research/neuroscience.html]).  

During my master's degree program at Uni Mannheim & University of Applied Sciences Albstadt-Sigmaringen, I expanded my knowledge and skills in data science. I deepened my understanding of machine learning, advanced statistics, big data, and data privacy. Furthermore, I specialized in Natural Language Processing (NLP), In the last year of my extra-occupational study my focus shifted towards specializing in Natural Language Processing (NLP). In my master's thesis, I explored the fascinating world of Transformers and developed a classification model architecture based on BERT

# ðŸ§—ðŸŒ² Leisure
Beyond coding, I am fueled by a passion for climbing and the exhilaration of discovering new countries and mountains through this sport. It fuels my spirit, igniting a sense of adventure and pushing me to embrace new challenges and testing my physical and mental limits to reach new heights.
